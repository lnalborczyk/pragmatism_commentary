	abstract = {The debate between Bayesians and frequentist statisticians has been going on for decades. Whilst there are fundamental theoretical and philosophical differences between both schools of thought, we argue that in two most common situations the practical differences are negligible when off-the-shelve Bayesian analysis (i.e., using ‘objective’ priors) is used. We emphasize this reasoning by focusing on interval estimates: confidence intervals and credible intervals. We show that this is the case for the most common empirical situations in the social sciences, the estimation of a proportion of a binomial distribution and the estimation of the mean of a unimodal distribution. Numerical differences between both approaches are small, sometimes even smaller than those between two competing frequentist or two competing Bayesian approaches. We outline the ramifications of this for scientific practice.},

	abstract = {Statistics has struggled for nearly a century over the issue of whether the Bayesian or frequentist paradigm is superior. This debate is far from over and, indeed, should continue, since there are fundamental philosophical and pedagogical issues at stake. At the methodological level, however, the debate has become considerably muted, with the recognition that each approach has a great deal to contribute to statistical practice and each is actually essential for full development of the other approach. In this article, we embark upon a rather idiosyncratic walk through some of these issues.},

	volume = {26},
	issn = {02776715, 10970258},
	doi = {10.1002/sim.2514},
	abstract = {E ect size estimates to be combined in a systematic review are often found to be more variable than one would expect based on sampling di erences alone. This is usually interpreted as evidence that the e ect sizes are heterogeneous. A random-e ects model is then often used to account for the heterogeneity in the e ect sizes. A novel method for constructing conÿdence intervals for the amount of heterogeneity in the e ect sizes is proposed that guarantees nominal coverage probabilities even in small samples when model assumptions are satisÿed. A variety of existing approaches for constructing such conÿdence intervals are summarized and the various methods are applied to an example to illustrate their use. A simulation study reveals that the newly proposed method yields the most accurate coverage probabilities under conditions more analogous to practice, where assumptions about normally distributed e ect size estimates and known sampling variances only hold asymptotically.
